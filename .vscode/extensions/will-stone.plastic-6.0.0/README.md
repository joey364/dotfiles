# Plastic

_[A simple syntax and UI theme for Visual Studio Code.](https://plastictheme.com/)_

---

If you were you using the _Plastic Legacy v2_ theme, this has now been
officially deprecated. The theme is still available, under the name _DEPRECATED
Plastic Legacy v2_, but will be removed in the next major release. If you are
using this, I urge you to volunteer to be its maintainer. See here for more
details: https://github.com/will-stone/plastic/issues/168

---

## Notable features

- Dark UI elements for all-day coding.
- Small colour palette to avoid visual overload.
- Additional deprioritised-punctuation theme; concentrate on the content.
