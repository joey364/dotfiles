## [6.0.0] - 2021-04-10

If you were you using the _Plastic Legacy v2_ theme, this has now been
officially deprecated. The theme is still available, under the name _DEPRECATED
Plastic Legacy v2_, but will be removed in the next major release. If you are
using this, I urge you to volunteer to be its maintainer. See here for more
details: https://github.com/will-stone/plastic/issues/168

## [3.0.0] - 2020-02-09

v3 introduces a new syntax colour: lavender for functions. This helps tone-down
the amount of whiskey colour, which is now mainly used for JSX props. The scopes
have also been simplified further, separating them into clear types. However,
worry not if you preferred v2, this can still be found in the theme-picker under
"Plastic Legacy v2".

- Simplified config and build script.

## [2.1.0] - 2018-06-10

Updates to the upcoming builder/compiler mean slight tweaks to the theme.

- JS terminator (semi-colons) are same as all other punctuation (use the
  deprioritised theme if you need these to be more subtle). This may change back
  in the future, depending on public opinion.
- Inactive tab text is darker.
- List active highlight swapped with list hover: active is now the lighter
  colour.

## [2.0.2] - 2018-06-03

- Looks like the move worked. Forgot the README though, this update adds it
  back.

## [2.0.1] - 2018-06-03

- This is a test to see if I can move the Plastic theme into a sub-directory. If
  it breaks the theme, I'll roll it back.

## [2.0.0] - 2018-05-30

- New v2 config system allows you to make your own variation of Plastic. More
  info soon.
- Even less specific scopes means Plastic really is a _simple theme_.
- Various workbench tweaks to standardise some colours.

v2 has been in the making for quite some time. Please report any issues on
GitHub.

## [1.11.2] - 2018-05-29

- v2's compiler ready.
- Deprioritised v2 theme.

## [1.11.1] - 2018-05-22

v2 beta: use v1 syntax colours (mainly).

## [1.11.0] - 2018-05-21

- I have been testing a new version for some time and am nearly ready to release
  Plastic v2!
  - Most colours have been tweaked to match their name on
    [Chirag's website](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/). e.g. Whiskey
    is now a solid whiskey colour instead of an approximation. This gives a more
    vibrant feel and better contrast.
  - Added an easier method to configure the theme. Now there's three config
    files: the colour names, syntax, and workbench configurations. A build
    script runs through these and outputs the resulting theme file in the themes
    folder. Clone the repo and try it yourself using `yarn build`.
  - The scope (syntax) have been simplified further, using (even more!) generic
    rules. I've tried to keep the scopes to two levels of specification, with a
    maximum of three if necessary.

Note: v2 will soon become the next version of Plastic so please provide
feedback. v1 will no longer be maintained and will eventually be removed. This
is due to the new way that the theme is built and configured (see above). This
theme will also no longer provide a deprioritised-punctuation version. However,
after v2 has been finalised, I will start a _Plastic Forks_ program, and will
add in a Plastic-Deprioritised-Punctuation theme as its first entry. If you rely
on this variation, I suggest sticking with the legacy version for now (I won't
remove it until the new one is released).
